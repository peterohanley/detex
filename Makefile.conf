# LIBRARY_CONFIGURATION determines whether a shared or static library will
# be built. Supported values are SHARED, STATIC and DEBUG (static with
# debugging and no optimization). The INCLUDE_DIR is the installation
# directory for library header file.
#
# The HEADER_FILE_INSTALL_DIR is the installation directory prefix for library
# header files. They will be installed in the subdirectory DataSetTurbo.
#
# SHARED_LIB_INSTALL_DIR and STATIC_LIB_INSTALL_DIR are the installation
# directories of the shared and static libraries. The target architecture
# triplet string TARGET_MACHINE, obtained from gcc -dumpmachine, may be
# prefixed with /usr/lib to generate a path like /usr/lib/x86_64-gnu-linux.
#
# The variable TARGET_MACHINE has been initialized with the default library
# directory for the architecture.

HEADER_FILE_INSTALL_DIR = /usr/include
